## Simulations

In order to validate properties of different regression models we will start with an artificial dataset.

0. Set N = 1000, d = 10, p = 2 and delta = 0.5.
1. Generate a matrix `X`. It should be a matrix of the size N x d. It can be filled with values from uniform distribution `U[0,1]`. Try `runif()` and `matrix` functions.
2. Generate the vector `y`. Values in `y` should be sum of random noise and linear predictor. Use a linear combination of first `p` columns with weights `delta` as linear predictor and add Gaussian random noise `N(0,1)`. Try functions `rnorm()`, `rowSums`.
So 
$$
y = X_1 + ... + X_p + e,
$$
where $$e \sim N(0,1)$$.
3. Create a data frame with column `y` and columns in `X`.

## Model fitting

There is a lot of ways to fit a model in R. We are going to work with the `caret` package - an uniform approach to predictive modelling. The learning slope is steep but the payoff is high.

1. Use the `caret::train` function to fit `lm` model. The argument `method = "lm"` should do the job.
2. Use `method = "knn"` to fit k nearest neighbours.
3. Use `method = "ctree"` to fit decision trees.

By default the `knn` and `ctree` are doing some optimisation to find best model parameters (like k). But let's talk about this option in future. 
Today we are going to work with a single model.

See the section 'Fitting Models Without Parameter Tuning' of http://topepo.github.io/caret/training.html to learn how to fit a model with selected k.

To find list of available models and their parameters check the list https://topepo.github.io/caret/modelList.html

## Model scoring

For each fitted model calculate the RSS statistic based on a new dataset.
So:

1. Generate a new data set `data.frame(y, X)` with same size and structure as before.
2. Apply the `caret::predict` function to find $$\hat y$$ on new independent data set.
3. Calculate the sum of squares of $$\hat_y - y$$ on this new dataset.
4. Repeat these calculations 100 times.
5. Plot distribution of SS with the use of boxplots.

Which method has the lowest SS?

## Model comparisons

Check which model has the lowest SS for:

1.  N = 1000, d = 10, p = 2 and delta = 0.5.
2.  N = 50, d = 20, p = 20 and delta = 0.5.
3.  N = 1000, d = 10, p = 10 and delta = 0.5.
4.  N = 1000, d = 2, p = 2 and delta = 0.5.

Surprised?

Let's see profiles of the SS as a function of: (use matplot or ggplot2) 

1. N = 10, 100, 1000,
2. d = 2, 5, 10, 20,
3. p = 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%,
4. delta = 0.2, 0.5, 0.9.

##  In case you really need it

```{r}
set.seed(1313)
N = 50
d = 20
p = 20
delta = 0.5

rr <- replicate(20, {
  
X <- matrix(runif(N*d), N, d)
y <- rowSums(X[, 1:p, drop=FALSE])*delta + rnorm(N)
df <- data.frame(y, X)

X2 <- matrix(runif(N*d), N, d)
y2 <- rowSums(X2[, 1:p, drop=FALSE])*delta + rnorm(N)
df2 <- data.frame(y2, X2)

library(caret)
library(party)

fit1 <- train(y~., data = df, method = "lm")

fitControl <- trainControl(method = "none")
fit2 <- train(y~., data = df, method = "knn", 
              trControl = fitControl, 
              tuneGrid = data.frame(k = 10))

fit3 <- train(y~., data = df, method = "ctree", 
              trControl = fitControl, 
              tuneGrid = data.frame(mincriterion = 0.9))

pf1 <- predict(fit1, df2)
pf2 <- predict(fit2, df2)
pf3 <- predict(fit3, df2)
c(lm = sum((pf1 - df2$y2)^2),
  knn = sum((pf2 - df2$y2)^2),
  ctree = sum((pf3 - df2$y2)^2))
})

boxplot(t(rr))
