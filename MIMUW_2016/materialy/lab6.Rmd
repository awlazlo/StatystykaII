## Association rules

We will be playing with data related to student grades. 
Let's use association rules to find some structure in data related to grades.


1. Load the dataset `archivist::aread("pbiecek/Przewodnik/arepo/12b75717051be0ae516b900e1e70c049")`. 
2. What is inside? Check first few rows. Plot the distribution of grades and codes and number of codes per student.
3. Use the `tidyr` package to convert this dataset into the wide format. The function `spread` will do the job. 
4. Create a binary matrix with two possible values TRUE (student gets grade higher or equal than 3) and FALSE (have not taken this course or got 2).
5. Convert this matrix into an objects of class `transactions`. Use the `as()` function for this. Note, that you need to load the `arules` package first.
6. Use the `apriori()` function to find rules with support >0.1
7. Use the `inspect` and `sort` functions to print rules sorted along the `lift`.
8. Install the `arulesViz` package. Use the `plot()` / `itemFrequencyPlot()` function to investigate the set of rules.

## Principal Components Analysis

Let's play with data related to movies, from Hollywood Insider.

1. Download data from `archivist::aread("pbiecek/Przewodnik/arepo/10aab376f2bc0001cbd1db1802e9fb53")`.
2. Limit this data only to movies from 2015 and choose columns 4:8.
3. Use the `prcomp()` function to find a PCA representation of this dataset.
4. Create a biplot. What can you say about this landscape of movies? Use either the `biplot()` function or the `autoplot()` function from the `ggfortify` package.
