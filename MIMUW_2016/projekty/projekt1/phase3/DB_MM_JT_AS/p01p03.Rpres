Station description
========================================================
Station **CNK07** consist of an experiment based on **Stroop effect**.

This effect is shown through a psychological experiment on **two different levels**. 

In the first one, the user is asked to press a button of the *same colour* as the word that he is reading.

But what if the word and its colour are *dissociated*?

This happens on the second level: the user has to follow the same procedure but this time itâ€™s much harder.

Clusters - previous approach
========================================================
Below there are presented clusters obtained *in the second 
phase*. They are constructed basing on scenes counts vectors.

Clusters - EM algorithm
========================================================

<br><br>

How many clusters should we look for? <br><br>

Let's start with the previous approach - **two clusters**.

Clusters - EM algorithm
========================================================
<br>

**Note:** It doesn't look good... 
Maybe there are more than two clusters?

Let's train EM algorithm using different numbers of components 
and see which one *minimizes BIC*.

We will train two different models: 
- "E" with equal variances,
- "V" with different variances.

Clusters - EM algorithm - BIC analysis
========================================================
<br><br>
**Note:** Models with different variances outperform models
with equal variance. <br><br>
It looks like adding just the first few clusters
improves BIC significantly.


Clusters - EM algorithm - BIC analysis
========================================================

<br><br><br>
We performed *Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio Test for the Number of Mixture Components*
to identify the most satisfying number of clusters.<br><br>
It turned out that this is **five**.

Stroop effect - is it proven by the data?
========================================================
<br>
FIRST OBSERVATION:
  - level one is played around 26000 times while level two only around 18500,
  - 24450 different users in level one, but only 16135 played the second level -> **exactly 66% of people who played level one go to the second level**,
  - **89%** of people who started first level and **87%** of those who started second level did see the result of the level they played.

SECOND OBSERVATION:
  - Frequencies of games per person divided into two levels are presented on the rigth,
  - We don't observe it from the table but some users played level one 27, 30 and 34 times.

**Level One**  

|   |Freq. |Relative Freq. |
|:--|:-----|:--------------|
|1  |20130 |82.7%          |
|2  |3364  |13.8%          |
|3  |598   |2.5%           |
|4+ |245   |1.0%           |

**Level Two**

|   |Freq. |Relative Freq. |
|:--|:-----|:--------------|
|1  |13799 |86.0%          |
|2  |1913  |11.9%          |

**Note:** Only people who completed both levels once and saw the results for both levels (some 14500 people) will be considered in further analysis.

========================================================  
<br> 
THIRD OBSERVATON:

  - From the plot we can observe that distributions are bell-shaped, we could consider them **normal curves with different means**,
  - **72.7%** of analysed people completed the first level faster.
  
    |          |1st Q. |Median |Mean  |3rd Q. |
    |:---------|:------|:------|:-----|:------|
    |Level One |31     |35     |36.18 |39     |
    |Level Two |34     |38     |39.41 |44     |
    
Stroop effect - is it proven by the data?
========================================================  
<br>

RESULTS:
 
 - Kolmogorov-Smirnov test **rejects the hypothesis about distributions equality**!
 
 - ANOVA **rejects the hypothesis about means equality**!
 
CONCLUSION:
  - From our analysis we can confirm, with a high level of confidence, that the Stoop Effect is present in people.
