[interpretation] 

Plots are so small. It is almost impossible to read titles or labels.
It is not clear which models you have compared. In the section 'Methods' you have listed 4 models, but the boxplot has only three elements and none of them looks like the random forest.
But it looks like the random forest is the model that you have finally selected (even if it was not mentioned before).
All these are just my guesses, but it should be clearly written.
I have no idea what is in the plot in the middle on the bottom.

It is not written how the MSE is calculated in your case. 
Have you divided data into training/test set?
