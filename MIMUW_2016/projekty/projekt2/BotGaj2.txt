Your report has more than 13 pages, and the first 50% may be easily skipped. 
Care more about reader. Do not include meaningless results (dump of traces from stepAIC, instead of this you could just include small table in a fraction of current space).

There is no point in showing mean of MSE with precision of 9 digits. It makes numbers harder to compare. Also sdâ€™s of MSE are not that easy to read as CI for MSE. In the point 5.3 you have plot but without names of 4 bars!
The key and most interesting part is the point 6. You could work on this table to make it easier to read (which variables are in which model)

Less is more (if the less is carefully selected)!

Having said that I am waiting for the third phase.
